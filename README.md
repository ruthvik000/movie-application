# Getting Started with Movie Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React MovieApplication](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

### `npm install`

Installs all the modules listed as dependencies in local node_modules folder

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `Design Decisions`

Used a default photo if picture is not coming back for movie.\
Used Yellow color for star rating because I believe it's widely accepted and user-friendly.\
Placed the Loading Indicator below the last image while requesting for next page, I kept this way since I believe the loading indicator will not look good if placed in center.\
To keep consistency while displaying TV shows used aired date to display below the title.

### `Future Improvements`
Adding a loading indicator to search field so that user can know that we are making the request and results are loading.\
Add sorting functionality based on Year released and title of a movie.\
Filter movies based on language so user can movie languages of their choice.
